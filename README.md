# SportsDataAnalytics
The purpose of this group project is to conduct an analysis on the optimal allocation of resources for a new team being created in Major League Baseball (MLB). The project aims to provide recommendations for the team's management on how to distribute their resources, such as budget, personnel, and facilities, to maximize the team's performance and achieve success in the league.

To achieve this goal, the project will involve a thorough examination of various factors that can influence the team's resource allocation, such as the team's market size, available talent pool, competitive landscape, and strategic priorities. The analysis will be conducted through a combination of quantitative and qualitative research methods, including data analysis, surveys, interviews, and literature review.

The project's findings and recommendations will be presented in a formal report, which will include a comprehensive overview of the team's resource allocation options, an evaluation of the pros and cons of each option, and a set of actionable recommendations for the team's management to implement. The report will also include a discussion of the limitations and potential future directions for the research.

Overall, this project aims to provide valuable insights and recommendations for a new MLB team to make informed decisions on how to allocate their resources to achieve long-term success in the league.
